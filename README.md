Bandcamp music player with a queue.

## Bandcamp integraiton

I also made a Firefox extension that adds "Enqueue in BC Player" context menu action so you can add albums to your listening queue directly from the Bandcamp feed page:

[ext.webm](https://github.com/torunar/bc-player/assets/1062217/58059ebb-c792-4636-b176-4a7550617fde)

You can download the extension here: [bc-player-helper.xpi](https://github.com/torunar/bc-player-helper/releases/download/latest/bc-player-helper.xpi).

## Reasoning behind the project

Bandcamp doesn't let you play multiple albums in a queue.
I didn't like it, so I fixed the problem the only way I know: with some good ol' HTML, CSS and JS.

## Privacy

BC Player only stores data in your browser's session storage.
The data stored is current playlist.

I don't collect any logs nor run any marketing research on you.
I don't and will never care about this stuff in my pet projects.

[corsproxy.io](https://corsproxy.io/) is used to fetch pages directly from Bandcamp, though. 
Read their [Privacy Policy](https://corsproxy.io/privacy/) to make sure you're okay with it.

## Contributing

I see this project as feature-complete. I will mostly focus on fixing bugs, but might add a thing or two occasionally.

If you are willing to contribute to the project, be my guest! Make forks, implement features, make pull requests.
